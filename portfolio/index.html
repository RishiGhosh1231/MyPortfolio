				<h3>I'm an Evolving Front End Web Developer</h3>
				<p>Hello, my name is Rishi Ghosh. I am a 18 years old web development student, i am doing specialization in CSS3 & Bootstrap as well as learning JavaScript for interactivity. Web designing or web developing is something that i am very fascinated about from a very young age.<br> So far i am well equipped to design professional business websites as well as some really cool and interactive websites. I do not have much work experience yet, but i am looking forward to new opportunities to gain more experience in this field and grow myself as a Front End Developer. I am still not a full time developer as because i am still a student and i am learning new things everyday, doing various courses and discovering all the interesting and fun things that we can do with these designing or programming languages. For me to choose something as your profession you must be passionate about it, you must have the urge to know more about it everyday and keep getting better and better, and that is why i chose to become a Front End Developer. I have always been a big fan of these fancy websites where you always get mesmerized whenever you open it, all the cool stuff that CSS is able to do is something that have always fascinated me. So i chose to learn all these things like a professional and in the learning process i understood that i have never been so passionate or excited about any of the things before and that is when i decided to take it as a profession. I am still young and not well recognised but i really look forward to grab all the possible opportunities that will come my way. One thing that i would like to share with you about my work is that i am very professional and punctual about my projects and i expect my clients to be equally professional and punctual with me. So far i am quite experienced in HTML5 and CSS3 but honestly i am still new to JavaScript and especially jQuery, but i am still able to design your pages interactively. It is just that if your requirements are something like an extremely complex web application, then it will be a bit difficult job for me because i am still learning these complex programming concepts, but if your requirement is a cool, responsive and interactive website or a completely professional business website then i you have just found the right guy ! you can contact me to know more about me and my works or if you are interested in working with me. <br><br> <b>Note: This Portfolio website is made by me so you can get a little bit of basic idea of my development skills. </b></p>
